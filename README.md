# Sentiment Analysis in R: The Tidy Way
<p>By <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jmperafan/">Juan Manuel Perafan</a></p>

Believe it or not? For a while I was interviewing to build my own course with DataCamp. It was supposed to be a course on Sentiment Analysis with R. I am very fond of the topic and I decided to apply. Why not? In the end, they found a more experience person to build the course, not hard feelings. But I still decided to upload the proposal I sent them to my Github. Who knows? Maybe one day I decide to finish up my course. 

This repository contains the course outline that I proposed and a Notebook with one of the exercises I created.
